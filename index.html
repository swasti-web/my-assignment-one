He pioneered the concept of providing small loans without collateral to impoverished individuals, particularly women, through his founding of the Grameen Bank in 1983. This innovative approach helped lift millions out of poverty by empowering them to start small businesses. Dr. Yunus's work has inspired global initiatives in poverty alleviation and social entrepreneurship.</p>
